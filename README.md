**Datamapper**

This caused us a bunch of headaches as we bumbled our way through including it, but became useful once we were familiar with it.

DataMapper is an ORM: an Object-Relational Mapping.Â 
Basically, it's a library that lets you work with your database from object-oriented code. Instead of writing any query code ourselves we include an adapter for mysql, postgresql or any other language we create our databases with.

In the gem file:
```
gem 'data_mapper'
gem 'dm-postgres-adapter'
```
To include in spec helper for tests and app for dev:
```
require 'data_mapper'
require 'dm-postgres-adapter'
```
